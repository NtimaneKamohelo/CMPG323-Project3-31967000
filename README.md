## About The Project
In this project I am requested to design an APP that will store EcoPower Logistics database in microsoft azure using Tier 1.

## Requirements
Functional requirements refer to the functionality that a system must have and how the functions should be performed. Non-functional requirements refer to the aspects of a solution that have an impact on the quality attributes of a system (or platform). These non-functional requirements are deemed as supportive requirements to ensure that the functional requirements are implemented appropriately and according to good software practices.

## Design Pattern Implementation
I created the Repository folder that stores the following classes and Interfaces:
- OrderRepository
- CustomerRepository
- OrderDetailsRepository
- ProductRepository
- IGenericRepository

## How to use the app as a user
